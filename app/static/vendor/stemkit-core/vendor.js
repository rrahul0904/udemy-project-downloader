/**
 * @module core/vendor
 *
 * Dependency-injection layer for STEMKit's vendored third-party libraries
 * (jStat, Papa Parse, regression.js, bibtex-parse-js).
 *
 * Why this exists
 * ---------------
 * The vendored files in `js/dependencies/` are UMD bundles. UMD detects its
 * host at run time and either assigns `module.exports` (CommonJS) or attaches
 * a global to `window` (browser). Neither path is reachable by a plain ES
 * module import:
 *
 *   - `import jStat from '../../js/dependencies/jstat.min.js'` yields no
 *     bindings, because the file has no `export` statements.
 *   - `import { createRequire } from 'module'` resolves under Node but is a
 *     hard *resolution* failure in a browser ("Failed to resolve module
 *     specifier 'module'"). A *static* import resolves before any code runs, so
 *     it cannot be guarded with try/catch. The dynamic form
 *     `await import('module')` does reject catchably, but the vendored
 *     libraries have to be available synchronously, so injection is preferred.
 *
 * Rather than branch on the environment inside every core module, which would
 * make the core untestable in one of the two targets, the core declares the
 * libraries it needs and each host registers them at start-up:
 *
 *   Browser:  the UMD `<script>` tags already set window.jStat, window.Papa,
 *             etc.; `registerFromGlobals()` picks them up.
 *   Node:     `registerVendor({ jStat: require('...') })` from the test setup.
 *
 * The core therefore stays environment-neutral, and the vendored libraries
 * remain the single source of truth for the numerics in both targets.
